# SandwichClub
In strings.xml there's a string called "sandwich_details" which contains 10 items. For some reason I cannot fathom, the second, fifth and seventh item stop the project from building because of a syntax failure or defect.
The only workaround I found in order to be able to actually open and work with the project was to replace the three items that do not work with the first item. Thus, there are repeated sandwiches in the UI of the DetailActivity class.
I haven't been able to find a way to solve the issue. I have talked to my tutor, Rodrigo Cericatto, and we could not fix this in any way.
Nevertheless, I believe I have attained the objectives for this project, namely:
•	Learn how to submit projects for review
•	Practice JSON parsing to a model object
•	Design an activity layout
•	Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
Therefore, I have decided to submit the app, even with the aforementioned (and evident) UI errors which neither my tutor or myself have been able to fix.
